## Initial Backlog Ideas

Below are initial user stories with priorities:

1. **As a user**, I want to create an account so I can manage my tasks securely. *(P1)*  
2. **As a user**, I want to log in and out safely to protect my personal data. *(P1)*  
3. **As a user**, I want to add tasks with a title, description, and due date so I don’t forget them. *(P1)*  
4. **As a user**, I want to be able to update or delete tasks so I can make changes as needed. *(P2)*  
5. **As a user**, I want to categorize tasks using custom tags for better organization. *(P3)*  
6. **As a user**, I want to view tasks in a list or calendar layout so I can plan ahead. *(P2)*  
7. **As a user**, I want to receive reminders before deadlines to help me stay on track. *(P2)*  
8. **As an admin**, I want to view all user activity logs to ensure proper system usage. *(P3)*  
9. **As a user**, I want to mark tasks as completed so I can track my progress. *(P2)*  
10. **As a team**, we want the app to be responsive and work on both desktop and mobile devices. *(P2)*
