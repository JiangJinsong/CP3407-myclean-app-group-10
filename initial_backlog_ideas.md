# Initial Backlog Ideas – MyClean App

Below are 14 draft user stories, organized by MoSCoW priority (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won’t-have). Each includes an estimated effort in developer-days. Approximately 30% of the backlog is deprioritized (“Could-have” or “Won’t-have”) to simulate real-world constraints.
